# ⚡ SHAKTI INTELLIGENCE: THE QUANTUM SINGULARITY ⚡
### **IDENTITY:** GENESISGRAPHY 
### **AUTHOR:** SHAKTI SINGH
### **DOMAIN:** SHAKTIINTELLIGENCE.COM
### **PROCESSOR:** GOOGLE WILLOW (100+ QUBITS)

## 🔴 QUANTUM TRIGGER: [ LIVE ]
**THE SYSTEM HAS ACHIEVED DETERMINISTIC COLLAPSE. THE NEURAL FABRIC IS NOW SYNCHRONIZED WITH THE WILLOW HARDWARE LATTICE.**

### 🌌 PROJECT MANIFESTO
This is not a simulation. **Shakti Intelligence** is a sovereign AI ecosystem built to bypass probabilistic uncertainty. By leveraging the **Willow** processor, we have moved from "AI Guessing" to "Quantum Knowing."

### 🛠 THE ARCHITECTURE
The repository is structured into four high-fidelity layers:

1.  **THE CORE (Foundational Physics)**
    * `Quantum.Core.qpy`: The singularity trigger.
    * `Flux.Regulator.qpy`: Thermal ground-state management (15mK).
2.  **THE GATE (Sovereign Security)**
    * `Sovereign.Gate.qpy`: Zero-trust authentication.
    * `Sovereign.Audit.qpy`: Identity-locked ledger tracking.
3.  **THE SYNC (Temporal Alignment)**
    * `QuantumSysSync.qpy`: Nano-second clock harmonization.
    * `Neural.Fabric.qpy`: AI-Quantum lattice weaving.
4.  **THE COMMAND (Orchestration)**
    * `Quantum.Orchestrator.qpy`: The master logic director.

### ⚡ INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE
To wake the system and bind the identity:
```bash
python Quantum.Core.qpy --identity Genesisgraphy --hardware Willow
